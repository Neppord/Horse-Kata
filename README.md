Horse Kata
===========

This is an exercise helping you to lern to test-drive filter, sort and paginate a bunch of data.
In this case the data concerns horses.

You have some sample data showing you what horse data could look like. You also
have examples of the kinds of filtering, sorting and pagination that might be required.

Your job is to implement the function in the horse backend marked with 'TODO' statements.
This function should filter, sort and paginate an arbitrary table of horse data, as specified.

Note on data size and performance: 
- Assume the table data will have no more than 50 000 rows and 100 columns, and will easily fit into available memory space.
- Assume you will filter on a maximum of 100 columns
- Assume you will only sort on one column
- Assume the pagination is for page sizes of anything from 1 to 500 rows.

Use Test-Driven Development!
